# ANNOUNCEMENT : This project is now deprecated

This project is now deprecated. For a more functional application of this project, please re-direct to [**voxelmap**](https://github.com/andrewrgarcia/voxelmap) and use the **voxelmap.Image('yourfilepath.png')** object and its ->make() and ->map3d() functions to map images to 3-D models. 

# 3Dmapping-algorithm
This code shows an algorithm for importing and mapping 2D images to 3D plots. Mapping algorithm: maps 2D binary image to 3D form by transforming relative pixel color to depth.

*Primary Code* - generated from the attached code [from *mapto3d.py*]

*Modern Code* - generated for a more recent code that uses the same algorithm but cuts the main algorithm code to 5 lines
and allows for the automation of generating N slices on the X-dimension without any additional code development.
