# 3Dmapping-algorithm
This code shows an algorithm for importing and mapping 2D images to 3D plots. Mapping algorithm: maps 2D binary image to 3D form by transforming relative pixel color to depth.

*Modern Code.png* - generated for a more recent code that uses the same algorithm but cuts the main algorithm code to 5 lines
and allows for the automation of generating N slices on the X-dimension without any additional code development.
